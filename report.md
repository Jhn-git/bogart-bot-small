Log Consolidation: Bogart Discord Bot

This log details the operation of the "Bogart" Discord bot, focusing on its WanderingService which selects channels to post messages in. The bot is experiencing two major, recurring errors that impact its stability and state management.

Executive Summary

The Bogart bot is partially functional but suffers from critical, repeating errors. It successfully performs its core task of identifying active channels and sending messages. However, its operation is frequently interrupted by network DNS failures (causing restarts) and file system permission errors (preventing state from being saved). A vast majority of channels are skipped due to missing permissions, which is expected but noisy.

Critical Errors

Two primary errors are crippling the bot's stability and persistence:

File System Permission Error (EACCES)

Log Entry: WanderingService: Error saving cooldowns to persistent storage: Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/app/data/cooldowns.json.tmp'

Problem: The bot process does not have write permissions for the /app/data/ directory. It attempts to save which servers it has visited (cooldowns.json) but fails every time.

Impact: Cooldowns are never saved to disk. After every restart, the bot has no memory of which servers it recently visited, potentially causing it to post to the same servers too frequently. This is confirmed by the startup message: WanderingService: Loaded 0 active cooldowns from persistent storage.

Network/DNS Lookup Failure (EAI_AGAIN)

Log Entry: Failed to log in: Error: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN discord.com

Problem: The bot's environment is unable to resolve the IP address for discord.com. This is a DNS lookup failure, indicating a temporary network issue or misconfiguration in the container/host's DNS settings.

Impact: The bot cannot connect to Discord's API, causing it to fail its login sequence and trigger a restart loop. This happened multiple times in the provided log.

Activity Timeline & Bot Behavior

The log covers several operational cycles, restarts, and a recovery.

Initial Operation:

The WanderingService starts its "decision cycle" and evaluates all 24 guilds.

It finds two eligible guilds: [ðŸ”¥NEWðŸ”¥] London Stories âš” (score: 172) and Yarichin B Club (score: 99).

It successfully sends a message to [ðŸ”¥NEWðŸ”¥] London Stories âš” but fails to save the cooldown state due to the EACCES error.

Second Message & Continued Failure:

In the next cycle, it successfully sends a message to Yarichin B Club but again fails to save the cooldown state.

System Instability & Restart Loop:

The bot begins experiencing the EAI_AGAIN network error, which prevents it from logging into Discord.

This results in a series of Failed to log in and Failed to start bot messages, followed by restart attempts.

Successful Restart & Resumed Operation:

The bot eventually overcomes the network issue and starts successfully (Bogart Discord Bot started successfully!).

Because cooldowns were never saved, it immediately re-evaluates all guilds as if it has never visited them.

Post-Restart Operation:

The bot once again identifies [ðŸ”¥NEWðŸ”¥] London Stories âš” and Yarichin B Club as top candidates.

It sends messages to both in subsequent cycles, with the EACCES error occurring after each successful send.

Operational Observations

Widespread Permission Issues: The bot logs a Missing permissions warning for hundreds of channels across most of the guilds. This is the primary reason most guilds are deemed to have No eligible channels found. Common patterns include:

Announcement/Rules Channels: The bot can view but not send messages (ViewChannel: true, SendMessages: false).

Private/Log Channels: The bot cannot view them at all (ViewChannel: false).

Channel Scoring: The bot uses a scoring system to find "eligible" channels. Channels in some guilds (Jhn N Juice, Gorgs not evil server) were found but skipped because their activity scores were too low (e.g., < 50).

Successful Targeting: The channel selection logic is working. It correctly identifies the most active, general-purpose chat channels in the servers where it has sufficient permissions:
