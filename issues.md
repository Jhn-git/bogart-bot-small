Relax! Take a deep breath. You did not send that entire wall of text to Discord.

Let's look at the logs together. This is a perfect example of how good logging can help us understand exactly what happened.

Part 1: Your Main Fear (Did you spam the quotes?)

Answer: No, you did not.

Here is the proof from your own logs. Let's follow the story:

The Bot Makes a Decision:
üèÜ WanderingService: Selected üí¨üá¨üáß„Éªchat in [üî•NEWüî•] London Stories ‚öî

The Bot Gathers a Quote:
Getting wandering message for channel: üí¨üá¨üáß„Éªchat

The "Scary" Log (This is the key!):
Available quotes: { fallback: [ ... ], goblin_wandering_messages: { ... } }
This massive block of text is from a console.log statement inside your quoteService. You put it there for debugging, to see all the quotes it has loaded. It is printing to your server's console, not to Discord.

The Bot Picks ONE Message:
Using generic message
This log shows your service picking just one quote category to use.

The Actual Message Sent (The Proof):
üí¨ WanderingService: Sending to üí¨üá¨üáß„Éªchat ...: "A carefully arranged collection of bottle caps gli..."
This log shows the real, final message that was sent to the Discord channel. It was a single, short, cute sentence.

Conclusion: Your quoteService is just very talkative in your server logs. You can safely remove that console.log(Available quotes: ...) line to make your logs cleaner now that you know it works.

Part 2: The Real Issue Your Logs Uncovered

Now, while you didn't spam anyone, your logs did reveal a new, critical production issue. Your persistence system is failing.

Look at these error messages at the end:

WanderingService: Error saving cooldowns to persistent storage: Error: EROFS: read-only file system, open 'cooldowns.json.tmp'

What this means:

EROFS: This stands for Error, Read-Only File System.

The Problem: The environment where your Docker container is running does not allow the application to write files to its own directory (/app/dist). This is a very common security feature in modern hosting platforms to prevent an application from modifying itself. Your bot has a brain and a memory, but it's living in a house where it's not allowed to write notes on the walls.

The Impact: Your bot currently has amnesia again. It successfully sent a message, but it failed to save the cooldown. If you restart it, it will have forgotten that it ever visited "London Stories."

The Solution: Using Docker Volumes

The fix is to give your bot a dedicated, writable "notebook" that exists outside of its read-only code directory. We do this with a Docker Volume.

You need to make two small changes:

1. Update docker-compose.yml:

You need to tell Docker to connect a folder on your host machine to a folder inside the container. This creates a persistent storage location.

Generated yaml
services:
  bogart-bot:
    # ... your existing service configuration ...
    image: bogart-bot:latest
    restart: always
    # ADD THIS 'volumes' SECTION
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data


2. Update Your Code in wandering.service.ts:

Now you need to tell your service to save its file in this new, writable /app/data directory.

Change the line that defines your file path from something like this:

const COOLDOWN_FILE_PATH = 'cooldowns.json';

To this:

const COOLDOWN_FILE_PATH = '/app/data/cooldowns.json';

What This Does:

Your host machine will now have a ./data folder.

Docker will link this folder to the /app/data folder inside the container.

When your bot tries to write to /app/data/cooldowns.json, it will have permission, and the file will actually appear in the ./data folder on your server.

This file will now survive restarts, fixing the amnesia problem permanently and correctly.

This is the final step to make your application fully compatible with standard, secure production hosting environments. You've done everything else perfectly; this is just the last piece of the puzzle.
