### Deployment Analysis & Summary

A new feature, the **"loneliness prevention system,"** was successfully merged from the `develop` branch into `main` and deployed to production. The CI/CD pipeline completed all steps, including tests, build, and container startup, without fatal errors.

However, the core issue identified in previous logs **persists in the new deployment**. The application is still unable to write to its data directory, resulting in a recurring `EACCES: permission denied` error when trying to save server cooldowns. This indicates that the root cause of the file permission issue was not resolved by this update.

### Chronological Breakdown

The log can be broken down into three distinct phases:

#### 1. Pre-Deployment: Testing and Code Merge

*   **Automated Testing (Jest):**
    *   A suite of 60 tests across 10 files was executed.
    *   The final summary reports **`10 passed, 10 total`**, indicating a successful test run.
    *   **Noteworthy Console Output:**
        *   Tests for `MessageCleanupService`, `QuoteService`, `GuildService`, etc., ran successfully with detailed console logging showing their internal logic.
        *   A test failure for `WanderingService` was logged mid-run (related to the `saveCooldowns` function), but the final summary still reported all tests as passed. This might indicate a test that correctly catches an expected error but logs verbosely.

*   **Source Code Merge:**
    *   The script confirmed that the pre-merge tests passed.
    *   A new commit was merged from `develop` into `main`:
        *   **Commit:** `923b570 âœ¨ Implement loneliness prevention system with "Long Time No See" bonus to enhance engagement for inactive servers...`
    *   The merge was successful and the changes were pushed to the remote `main` branch.

#### 2. Deployment: Docker Build & Launch

*   **Docker Image Build:**
    *   The deployment script stopped and removed the old running container.
    *   A new Docker image was built successfully. Key steps in the `Dockerfile` are visible:
        *   It uses a multi-stage build to create a lean production image.
        *   It correctly creates a non-root user (`bogart`, UID `1001`).
        *   **Crucially, it attempts to fix permissions:** The command `chown -R bogart:nodejs /app` is run to give the application user ownership of the app directory.

*   **Container Launch:**
    *   The new image was used to start the `bogart-bot-small-prod` container.
    *   The container started successfully and passed its health check.
    *   The deployment was reported as complete and successful.

#### 3. Post-Deployment: Live Operation

*   **Successful Startup:** The bot application starts, logs in as `Bogart#2558`, and connects to 24 servers.
*   **First Decision Cycle:**
    *   The `WanderingService` begins its first cycle to find a server to post in.
    *   It correctly identifies `[ðŸ”¥NEWðŸ”¥] London Stories âš”` as the top candidate.
    *   It successfully sends a message to the channel.
*   **Recurring Critical Error:**
    *   Immediately after sending the message, the application tries to save the server cooldown state and fails with the exact same error as before:
      ```
      WanderingService: Error saving cooldowns to persistent storage: Error: EACCES: permission denied, open '/app/data/cooldowns.json.tmp'
      ```

### Root Cause Analysis & Recommendation

The problem is a **file system permission issue inside the Docker container**.

Despite the `chown` command in the `Dockerfile`, the `bogart` user does not have permission to write to the `/app/data` directory at runtime. This is almost certainly because the `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to use a **bind mount** for the `./data` directory.

A bind mount maps a host machine's directory into the container, and the host's permissions take precedence, overriding any permissions set inside the Docker image.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Inspect `docker-compose.yml`:** The primary fix is to stop using a host bind mount for the `/app/data` directory, which is causing permission conflicts.
2.  **Switch to a Named Volume:** The best practice is to use a Docker-managed **named volume**. This isolates the data from the host's file system and allows Docker to correctly manage permissions as defined in the `Dockerfile`.

    *Example change in `docker-compose.yml`:*

    ```yaml
    # OLD (Likely what is being used)
    services:
      bogart-bot:
        volumes:
          - ./data:/app/data # This causes permission issues

    # NEW (Recommended fix)
    services:
      bogart-bot:
        volumes:
          - bogart_data:/app/data # Use a named volume

    volumes:
      bogart_data: # Define the named volume
    ```
