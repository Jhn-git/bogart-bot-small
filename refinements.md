3. Potential Edge Cases & Final Polish (Minor Considerations)
These are not flaws, but final "what-if" checks to ensure maximum resilience.
The "Zero Human" Channel: Consider a channel where the last 15 messages are all from bots. Your logic will correctly result in a human participant count of zero, leading to a diversity score of zero and a 90% penalty. This should result in a final score so low that the channel is never chosen. This seems to be handled perfectly, but it's good to confirm that a zero-human-author scenario gracefully results in a near-zero score.
Application of the Modifier: You mention applying the modifier to "both diversity and recency scores." This works. An alternative, and perhaps slightly simpler, approach would be to calculate the total_score from all factors first, and then apply the single human-activity modifier at the very end. Neither way is wrong, but applying it once to the final score can sometimes make the individual impact of the modifier easier to reason about. This is a minor implementation detail, not a required change.
