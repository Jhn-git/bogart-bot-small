# Multi-guild operation is SAFE and NORMAL. ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS is optional and intended for development/testing only.
# In production, leave this unset to allow the bot to operate in all invited guilds.
# Security is provided by intelligent rate limiting and channel discovery, not by guild restriction.
#
# To restrict the bot to specific guilds during development/testing, add one or more Guild IDs, separated by commas.
# Example:
# ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS=1105309398705897633
